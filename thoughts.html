  <b> <p>1.<i><q> HARD WORK IS WORTHLESS FOR THOSE THAT DON’T BELIEVE IN THEMSELVES. </q></i> </p> 
    <p>2.<i><q>THE MOMENT PEOPLE COME TO KNOW LOVE, THEY RUN THE RISK OF CARRYING HATE.</q></i></p>
    <p>3.<i><q>SOMEBODY TOLD ME I’M A FAILURE, I’LL PROVE THEM WRONG.</q></i></p>
    <p>4.<i><q>WHEN PEOPLE GET HURT, THEY LEARN TO HATE… WHEN PEOPLE HURT OTHERS, THEY BECOME HATED AND RACKED WITH GUILT. BUT KNOWING THAT PAIN ALLOWS PEOPLE TO BE KIND. PAIN ALLOWS PEOPLE TO GROW… AND HOW YOU GROW IS UP TO YOU.</q></i></p>
    <p>5.<i><q>FAILING DOESN’T GIVE YOU A REASON TO GIVE UP, AS LONG AS YOU BELIEVE.</q></i></p>
    <p>6.<i><q>GROWTH OCCURS WHEN ONE GOES BEYOND ONE’S LIMITS. REALIZING THAT IS ALSO PART OF TRAINING.</q></i></p>
    <p>7.<i><q>THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS AREN’T WRITTEN IN BOOKS. YOU HAVE TO LEARN THEM BY EXPERIENCING THEM YOURSELF.</q></i></p>
    <p>8.<i><q>IN THE WORLD, NO ONE IS PERFECT. EVEN IF YOU KEEP PURSUING PERFECTION, YOU'LL NEVER REACH IT. BUT ALONG THE WAY, YOU'LL BECOME SOMETHING GREAT.</q></i></p>
    <p>9.<i><q>SOMETIMES YOU MUST HURT IN ORDER TO KNOW, FALL IN ORDER TO GROW, LOSE IN ORDER TO GAIN BECAUSE LIFE’S GREATEST LESSONS ARE LEARNED THROUGH PAIN.</q></i></p>
    <p>10.<i><q>IF YOU BELIEVE IN YOUR DREAMS, I WILL PROVE TO YOU, THAT YOU CAN ACHIEVE YOUR DREAMS JUST BY WORKING HARD.</q></i></p> </b>
